    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Game Torch</strong> (the “Game”) • Last updated: <time datetime="2025-12-29">December 29, 2025</time></p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Plain‑English summary</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No account required.</strong> Game Torch does not require you to create an account or sign in.</li>
        <li><strong>No analytics by default.</strong> We do not run third‑party analytics or ad tracking in the Game.</li>
        <li><strong>Local-only save data.</strong> Your “seen / kept / skipped” history and preferences are stored locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Steam is separate.</strong> When you open a Steam store page or trailer, Valve/Steam may collect data under their own policies.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how Game Torch (“we”, “us”, “our”) handles information when you use the Game.
    </p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>We do not collect personal information on our servers through the Game.</strong>
      The Game is designed to run locally on your computer.
    </p>

    <h3>Network connections</h3>
    <p>
      Game Torch does not contact our servers during normal use. Updates are delivered through Steam.
      If you choose to open external links (for example, a Steam store page or trailer), those third-party services may collect data under their own policies.
    </p>

    <h3>Information stored locally on your device</h3>
    <p>
      To make the Game work, Game Torch stores certain information locally, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Games you have <strong>seen</strong>, <strong>kept</strong>, or <strong>skipped</strong>.</li>
      <li>Run progress such as run count and other basic session state.</li>
      <li>Preferences (for example: safe mode / adult content preference, run length, onboarding flags).</li>
      <li>Optional curation markers you choose (for example: “Lit by Game Torch” style flags, if present).</li>
      <li>Local diagnostic logs used to troubleshoot problems (if enabled in your build).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is stored on your computer (for example under your user profile/application data folder) and is not uploaded to us automatically. If you contact support, you may choose to share logs with us (for example, by attaching them to an email).
    </p>

    <h3>Information we do not collect</h3>
    <p>
      We do not collect through the Game:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your name, address, or phone number</li>
      <li>Payment information</li>
      <li>Your Steam account credentials</li>
      <li>Precise location data</li>
      <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use information</h2>
    <p>
      The Game uses local data only to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remember what you’ve seen/kept/skipped so your discovery experience stays consistent.</li>
      <li>Apply your preferences (for example: filtering or safety options).</li>
      <li>Help diagnose crashes or bugs (local logs).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing and disclosure</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information.
      Because the Game does not upload your personal information to our servers, we generally do not share it.
    </p>

    <h3>Third-party services (Steam/Valve)</h3>
    <p>
      Game Torch can open Steam store pages, Steam trailers, or other external links.
      Those pages and services are operated by third parties (for example, Valve).
      Their collection and use of information is governed by their privacy policies and terms.
    </p>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      Local Game data remains on your device until you delete it, uninstall the Game, or otherwise remove the Game’s local files.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable steps to keep the Game’s local data handling simple and minimize data exposure.
      However, no method of storage is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Game is not designed to knowingly collect personal information from children.
      If you believe a child has provided personal information to us through a channel outside the Game, please contact us so we can address it.
    </p>

    <h2>International users</h2>
    <p>
      Game Torch is distributed internationally. Because the Game stores data locally and does not upload it to our servers by default,
      cross-border transfer of personal information by us is generally not applicable.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      If we change this Privacy Policy, we will update the “Last updated” date above.
      If we ever add features that collect or transmit personal data, we will update this policy accordingly.
    </p>
