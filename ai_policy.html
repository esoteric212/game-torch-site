    <h1>AI Use & Content Disclosure</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Game Torch</strong> • Last updated: <time datetime="2025-12-29">December 29, 2025</time></p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Quick summary</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI-assisted marketing:</strong> Some promotional assets (for example: trailer visuals, key art drafts, or music beds) may be created with generative AI tools during development.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-assisted in-game assets:</strong> Some in-game audiovisual assets (for example: background videos and/or music used for the “Mine” gameplay mode (the minecart discovery experience)) may be created with generative AI tools during development and shipped as <em>pre-generated</em> files.</li>
        <li><strong>No live AI generation:</strong> Game Torch does not generate new images, text, or audio in real time using AI while you play (no LLM chat, no runtime image generation).</li>
        <li><strong>No training on your data:</strong> We do not train AI models on your personal data.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Why we’re publishing this</h2>
    <p>
      Some players care about how creative and technical assets are produced. We think transparency is good for trust.
      This page explains, at a high level, where AI tools may be used in the Game Torch project.
    </p>

    <h2>Where AI may be used</h2>
    <p>
      We may use AI tools during development to help create or refine certain assets and metadata. Steam’s disclosure system distinguishes between
      <strong>Pre‑Generated</strong> AI (created during development) and <strong>Live‑Generated</strong> AI (created while the game is running). Game Torch uses <strong>Pre‑Generated</strong> AI assets only.
    </p>

    <h3>Pre‑Generated AI (during development)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In-game audiovisual assets</strong> (for example: background videos for the “Mine” gameplay mode and/or music beds shipped with the Game).</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing assets</strong> (for example: trailer visuals, key art drafts, promotional images/video).</li>
      <li><strong>Text assistance</strong> (for example: drafting copy, internal metadata summaries, or help text).</li>
      <li><strong>Curation assistance</strong> (for example: AI-assisted tagging/classification to help identify game “vibes” and filter content; reviewed as part of the workflow).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Live‑Generated AI (while the Game is running)</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Not used.</strong> Game Torch does not generate new images, text, voice, or audio in real time using AI while you play.
    </p>

    <h3>Where AI is not used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User data training:</strong> We do not use your personal data to train AI models.</li>
      <li><strong>Final curation decisions:</strong> AI does not make the final decision about which games are included in the mines. AI tools may assist with tagging/triage, but final inclusion/exclusion is human-reviewed.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessing your Steam account:</strong> Game Torch does not ask for your Steam login credentials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Human control and review</h2>
    <p>
      When AI tools are used, they are used as part of a human-directed workflow. We review outputs before shipping them in a build,
      and we prioritize clarity, usability, and tone consistency with the Game Torch aesthetic.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-party content and rights</h2>
    <p>
      Game Torch’s purpose is to showcase and help you discover real games on Steam.
      All third-party game pages, trailers, and store assets are owned by their respective rights holders. Please note that third-party games discovered through Game Torch may have their own AI policies and AI usage, which are subject to each developer’s disclosures (for example on their Steam store page).
      When Game Torch links to or embeds content from third parties, those services may have their own policies.
    </p>

    <h2>How this relates to Steam’s disclosures</h2>
    <p>
      Steam may display AI-related disclosure text on the store page based on the Steamworks Content Survey. We complete that survey and disclose AI usage there.
      This page is an additional, easy-to-find explanation for players who want more context.
    </p>

    <h2>Updates to this page</h2>
    <p>
      If we update how AI is used in Game Torch, we will revise this page and update the “Last updated” date at the top.
    </p>
